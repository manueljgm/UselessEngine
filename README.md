# UselessEngine

## Overview

**UselessEngine** is a protocol-oriented game engine framework for action based games. This engine is adaptable to specific gameplay requirements and features highly flexible, composable game objects with parent-child support, robust state management, event triggers, and efficient collision detection in a 3D space. Also included is a sprite-based animation engine with graphics layering support.

I originally began this project years ago to familiarize myself with game programming concepts and have been refining it ever since!
